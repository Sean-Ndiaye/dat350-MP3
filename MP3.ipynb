    "based on the results i gathered, all of the models had high bias, and were often underfitted as a result.  The low R-squared and low accurach contributed to this conclusion on all the models. This could point to the fact that there are other factors that contribute to number of friends based on what a student posts."

    "1. Find a dataset that interests you. Any dataset will work, but I highly recommend that you look around on kaggle for a dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets Links to an external site.). It has thousands of free datasets, all in different fields and topics. Pick a dataset that interests you. Note that you must choose a dataset that is not already cleaned. It is not required that you do every step of the data cleaning pipeline (for example, it is ok if the dataset you choose does not have missing values), but one goal of this assignment is to give you further practice of going through the data cleaning pipeline."

Your boss will also want information regarding the accuracy of the models. Your boss will also want to hear a discussion on whether you think your model has too much bias or variance. Here are some things to note:\n",
